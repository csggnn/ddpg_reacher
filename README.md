# DDPG Reacher

**DDPG Reacher** is a PyTorch project implementing a reinforcement learning 
agent controlling a ouble-jointed arm in a *Reacher Environment*. 
In a Reacher Environemnt, a targets moves around a robotic arm, and the reinforcement learning agent must be trained to 
maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The agent in this project implements [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) and was developed as
 a solution to  the continuous contol project for the 
[Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).
